Now, with our new Valtech Catalyst, multi-brand organizations can deploy their brand sites on XM Cloud in less time, reducing cost, improving quality, and increasing consistency of the site deployment.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWebsite deployments for large brands with hundreds of sites can typically take 50+ days - per brand site - to rollout.
